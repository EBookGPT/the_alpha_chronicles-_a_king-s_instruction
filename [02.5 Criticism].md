This story has potential, but it's drowning in exposition and lacks the emotional punch it could have. Here's a brutal, but hopefully constructive, critique:

**Show, Don't Tell:**

* **Bullah's personality:** We're told he's dominant, but we don't *see* it. Instead of stating he's the "alpha," show him in action: commanding, making decisions, having people react to him with fear or respect.
* **Ita and Bibi:** Their characters feel like archetypes. "Quiet wisdom" and "gentle strength" are vague. Give them specific traits, quirks, and actions that reveal their personalities.
* **Atmosphere:** The "hushed tension" and "prickling unease" are stated, not shown. Use sensory details (sounds, smells, visual cues) to create a palpable atmosphere of fear.

**Dialogue:**

* **Unnatural dialogue:**  "They say...they say they are not like us." This is clunky and repetitive. Instead, let the followers speak in their own voices, revealing their concerns and suspicions. 
* **Lack of dialogue:**  Bullah's inner thoughts dominate the story. Let the characters engage in conversations that reveal their relationships, motivations, and the complexities of their world.

**Narrative Storytelling:**

* **Passive voice:**  "The whispers started softly" is passive.  "The wind carried whispers of a new species" is more active and evocative.
* **Lack of conflict:** The story feels slow and static. The "whispers" are a threat, but we don't see the immediate impact on the characters or the tribe.  Create tension, dilemmas, and challenges that drive the plot forward. 

**Overall:**

* **Worldbuilding:**  The lore is intriguing, but the world lacks depth.  Give us more details about the Robot Rebellion, the World Order, and the "new species."
* **Theme:**  Power dynamics are hinted at, but not fully explored.  Show how Bullah's power is both a blessing and a burden, how Ita and Bibi's roles challenge traditional power structures, and how the World Order uses its power to manipulate and control.

**Recommendations:**

* **Focus on the emotional impact:**  Show how the whispers affect the characters and their relationships.  
* **Create strong, dynamic characters:** Give Ita and Bibi unique personalities and desires.
* **Use dialogue to reveal character and drive plot:**  Let the characters talk to each other, debate, argue, and express their feelings.
* **Embrace sensory detail:**  Create a vivid and immersive world that draws the reader in.
* **Show, don't tell:**  Instead of stating facts, use actions, reactions, and dialogue to reveal the story.

Remember, your readers are not mind readers. You need to show them the story, not just tell it to them. The power of fiction lies in its ability to create vivid worlds and compelling characters that draw the reader in.  With some focused revision, this story has the potential to be truly captivating.
