This story is a mess.  It's like someone took a bunch of sci-fi tropes, tossed them in a blender, and then tried to glue them together.  The writing is weak, the characters are flat, and the plot is predictable.  The author needs to seriously reconsider how they're telling this story.  

**Here's a breakdown of what's wrong:**

* **Too Much Telling, Not Enough Showing:**  The author relies heavily on exposition to tell us about the world, the characters, and the plot.  We're told that Bullah is a strong leader, but we don't see him in action.  We're told that the followers are afraid of the new species, but we don't experience their fear.  Instead of telling us, show us these things through dialogue, action, and sensory details. 
* **Flat Characters:**  The characters are one-dimensional, lacking depth and complexity.  Bullah is a gruff leader, Ita is the wise one, Bibi is the loyal one, and the Rebels are all just rebels.  Give them internal conflicts, personal motivations, and let them grow and change throughout the story.
* **Predictable Plot:** The plot follows a predictable formula.  Rumors of a new threat, a cryptic message, a secret meeting, a choice to rebel, a battle against the World Order, and a triumphant victory.  Surprise us!  Introduce unexpected twists, plot threads that weave together in surprising ways, and characters with agency who make choices that move the story in unexpected directions.
* **Cliché Language:** The author uses a lot of cliché language, phrases like "a palpable tension simmered" or "a darkness loomed."  This makes the story feel generic and unoriginal.  Use vivid language, fresh metaphors, and unique imagery to bring the world to life.
* **Lack of Dialogue:** The dialogue is flat and uninspired.  It doesn't reveal character, move the plot forward, or create tension.  Work on making your dialogue more realistic and engaging. 

**Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of telling us that Bullah is a strong leader, show us through his actions.  How does he command respect? How does he handle conflict?  
* **Give your characters depth:**  Explore their motivations, their fears, their hopes, and their dreams.  What are they fighting for? What are they afraid of losing?
* **Create a unique world:**  Develop the lore of Rokej-3 and the Robot Rebellion.  What are the specific details of this world that make it distinct from other sci-fi settings?
* **Use vivid language:**  Paint a picture with your words.  Describe the textures, sounds, and smells of the marketplace.  Let the reader experience the story through their senses.
* **Write compelling dialogue:**  Use dialogue to reveal character, move the plot forward, and create tension.  
* **Embrace the unexpected:** Don't be afraid to break from the formula.  Introduce plot twists, surprising revelations, and unexpected character arcs.

**Remember:** A good story is about more than just the plot.  It's about creating a world that is both believable and intriguing, characters that are relatable and compelling, and a story that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.  

Don't be afraid to experiment, to take risks, and to push the boundaries of your creativity.  

This story has the potential to be good, but it needs a lot of work.  Take the time to rewrite it, focusing on showing instead of telling, developing your characters, and creating a world that is both unique and compelling.
